# Addie Barron - Datamade code challenge

Hello DataMade crew! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my code challenge

I set up Parserator to run like so: type an address and submit, and youâ€™ll see either a table of parsed address information OR an error showing what went wrong on the back end. Youâ€™ll also see a bespoke error if something goes wrong during the AJAX request, just in case of network troubles (stop the server and try a submit if youâ€™re curious).

Looking forward to hearing back! ðŸ¦‘
